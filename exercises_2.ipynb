    "# Exercise 1 | Temperature Converter Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "Create two functions:\n",
    "1. `celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius)`: Converts Celsius to Fahrenheit\n",
    "2. `fahrenheit_to_celsius(fahrenheit)`: Converts Fahrenheit to Celsius\n",
    "\n",
    "Then create a main function `temperature_converter()` that:\n",
    "1. Asks the user to choose a conversion direction (C to F or F to C)\n",
    "2. Prompts for the temperature to convert\n",
    "3. Calls the appropriate conversion function\n",
    "4. Prints the result\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Signatures\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius):\n",
    "    # Your code here\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "def fahrenheit_to_celsius(fahrenheit):\n",
    "    # Your code here\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "def temperature_converter():\n",
    "    # Your code here\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "# This is how your function will be called:\n",
    "temperature_converter()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Output\n",
    "```\n",
    "Choose conversion direction:\n",
    "1. Celsius to Fahrenheit\n",
    "2. Fahrenheit to Celsius\n",
    "Enter your choice (1 or 2): 1\n",
    "Enter temperature in Celsius: 100\n",
    "100째C is equal to 212째F\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose conversion direction:\n",
    "1. Celsius to Fahrenheit\n",
    "2. Fahrenheit to Celsius\n",
    "Enter your choice (1 or 2): 2\n",
    "Enter temperature in Fahrenheit: 32\n",
    "32째F is equal to 0째C\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hints\n",
    "1. The formula for Celsius to Fahrenheit is: (C * 9/5) + 32\n",
    "2. The formula for Fahrenheit to Celsius is: (F - 32) * 5/9\n",
    "3. Use `input()` to get user input and `int()` or `float()` to convert it to a number\n",
    "4. Use conditional statements in `temperature_converter()` to determine which conversion function to call\n",
    "5. Round the results to 2 decimal places using `round(number, 2)`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note\n",
    "Make sure to handle potential ValueError exceptions if the user enters invalid input."

    "### Task\n",
    "Complete the following function `guess_number()` that implements a number guessing game. The function should:\n",
    "1. Generate a random number between 1 and 100 (inclusive)\n",
    "2. Repeatedly ask the user for guesses\n",
    "3. Provide feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct\n",

    "def guess_number():\n",
    "    # Your code here\n",

    "\n",
    "### Output Format\n",
    "Your function should print feedback for each guess and return the number of attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\n",
    "Enter your guess: 50\n",
    "Too high! Try again.\n",
    "Enter your guess: 25\n",
    "Too low! Try again.\n",
    "Enter your guess: 37\n",
    "Congratulations! You've guessed the number!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hints\n",
    "1. Use the `random` module to generate a random number.\n",
    "2. Use `input()` to get user guesses.\n",
    "3. Convert the user's input to an integer for comparison.\n",
    "4. Use a while loop to continue asking for guesses until the correct number is guessed.\n",
    "5. Keep track of the number of attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note\n",
    "Make sure to handle potential ValueError exceptions if the user enters non-integer input."
