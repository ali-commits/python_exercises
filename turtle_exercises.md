# Python Turtle Exercises with User Input

## **Easy**

### 1. Draw a Line with User-Specified Length
- **Task**: Ask the user to input the length of a line, then draw the line using that length.

### 2. Draw a Polygon with User-Specified Number of Sides
- **Task**: Ask the user for the number of sides and the length of each side, then draw the corresponding polygon.
- **Hint**: The angle for turning is `360 / number_of_sides`.

### 3. Draw a Colored Shape
- **Task**: Ask the user to input the shape (e.g., square, triangle) and a color, then draw the shape in the specified color.

## **Medium**

### 4. Draw a Spiral with User-Specified Parameters
- **Task**: Ask the user for the number of loops and the increment in line length, then draw a spiral.
- **Hint**: Increase the length of the line in each iteration.

### 5. Draw Multiple Shapes Based on User Input
- **Task**: Ask the user how many shapes they want to draw and the type of each shape (circle, square, etc.). Draw the shapes accordingly.
- **Hint**: Use a loop to repeat the drawing process.

## **Hard**

### 6. Create a Drawing Application
- **Task**: Allow the user to draw by specifying shapes, colors, and positions multiple times.
- **Hint**: Use a loop to repeatedly ask for user input until they choose to stop.

### 7. Generate Patterns Based on User Input
- **Task**: Ask the user for a pattern type (e.g., star, spiral) and the number of iterations. Draw the specified pattern multiple times.
- **Hint**: You can create functions for different patterns and call them based on user input.
